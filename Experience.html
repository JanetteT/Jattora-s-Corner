        <h3>Experience</h3><hr>
        <ul><li>My experience was more focused on geophiysical survey and its data, but being a geophysical student also involves
            some programming skills.</li>
        <li>This led me to the programming world and there I found my interest and passion. This is what I want to do!</li></ul>
