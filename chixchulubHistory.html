            <p>The Chicxulub Crater is an impact structure formed by the collision of a meteorite on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, 
                around 66 million years ago.
                It was 10 km in size and had a speed of 20 km/s.<br><br>
                The impact vaporized thousands of rocks.
                It struck the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, near Chicxulub Pueblo.<br><br>
                It left an enormous crater nearly 200 km wide and generated an initial tsunami with waves 1.5 km high.
                And subsequent tsunamis with waves over 100 m tall. <br><br>
                The ejected material was sulfur-rich gypsum and water which caused a nuclear winter
                Nearly 70% of all species died out, including the majority of dinosaurs.<br><br>
                Climate change following the impact was the cause of the mass extinction. <br><br>
                The Chicxulub crater is the remnant of that impact.

    <div class="paragraphChicxulub">
        <ul>
            <p >The Chicxulub crater was covered by younger deposits of limestones due to erosion and geological activity.
                Because it was partially offshore, nobody could actually see the structure.<br><br>
                In 1980, scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez discovered a layer rich in Iridium. This element is incredibly rare on Earth, but common in asteroids.
                Their research led to a stunning conclusion: this iridium layer was the geological signature of the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction.<br><br>
                Separately, other geophysicists noticed a distinct symmetrical magnetic anomaly on survey maps of the Yucatán Peninsula.
                In the center of this anomaly, they found minerals that had been instantly modified by extreme heat and pressure.<br><br>
                The initial surveys that hinted at the crater's existence weren't looking for an impact site at all—they were just searching for oil.
